Created On: 31 July 2025
Tool Used: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio service
Language: Python (for prediction script)

Description:
This project uses IBM AutoAI to build a machine learning model that predicts PM2.5 levels based on various air quality and weather parameters. The dataset includes features like PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

Output:
A deployed machine learning model that takes test input and predicts PM2.5 levels via API or notebook.
