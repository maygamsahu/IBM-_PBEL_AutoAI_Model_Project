# IBM-_PBEL_AutoAI_Model_Project
This project uses IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to build a predictive model for PM2.5 levels using features like PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The best pipeline is auto-selected, deployed as a REST API, and accessed via a Python script for real-time predictions.
